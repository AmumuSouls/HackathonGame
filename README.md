# HackathonGame

Game developed in python for teaching Quantum Computing. In this game the players will have access to several levels containing circuits 
that they will have to solve. To solve them, they will have access to several weapons that simulate the different gates available in qiskit.
With this weapons the objective is to set up the state of the circuit to be measured as 1 with only one attack in the case of the circuits
composed by 1 q-bit and 2 attacks in case of circuits composed by 2 q-bit.

The game is available in a console version and in a more graphical version using pygame. In the graphical version there are still missing
some parts of the visualization of the data as well as the logical behaviour of the 2-q bit circuits.
